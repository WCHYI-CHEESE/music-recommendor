### Dataset

The data this week comes from BBC Music by way of Simon Jockers at Datawrapper.

The raw data can be found on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-04-14/polls.csv.  
Album covers were retrived from Spotify, and you can access them via the Spotify API.

> Earlier this year, BBC Music asked more than 100 critics, artists, and other music industry folks from 15 countries for their five favorite hip-hop tracks. 
> Then they broke down the results of the poll into one definitive list. 
> But BBC Music didnâ€™t just publish a best-of list, they also published the complete poll results and a description of the simple algorithm they ranked the songs with.  - Simon Jockers
